      As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set
      out walking once more.

        >It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth </span
      >In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his
      locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:<span
        style="color: red"

        "What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is
        invisible..."</span
      >As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to
      myself, again:<span style="color: red"
        >"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping
        here, is his loyalty to a flower--the timage of a rose that shines
        through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is
        asleep..."</span
      >And I felt him to be more fragile still.
      <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"
        >I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that
        might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</span
